    services, and dynamic websites with the .NET platform. 

ASP.NET Core web API!
    ASP.NET Core Web API is a modern, open-source, and cross-platform framework from Microsoft for building HTTP-based services, 
    also known as RESTful APIs. 
    
    It allows different applications, such as web frontends, mobile apps, and other backend services, to communicate 
    and exchange data over the internet, typically using JSON or XML formats. 

NodeJS!
    Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers 
    to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. 

    It is primarily used for building fast, scalable network applications, APIs, and server-side services. 

Typescript!
    TypeScript is a free and open-source superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features, 
    primarily designed to build large-scale applications. 
    All valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. 

Javascript!
    JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language and one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, 
    alongside HTML and CSS. It is primarily used to make web pages interactive and dynamic, running directly in the user's web browser. 

JSON!
    JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight, text-based, and language-independent data-interchange format 
    used for storing and transporting data, primarily between a server and web application. 
    
    It uses human-readable text to represent data objects consisting of key-value pairs and arrays, 
    making it a popular, simpler alternative to XML for APIs. 

RestfulAPI!
    A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is an architectural style 
    for designing networked applications that uses standard HTTP protocols to enable communication between different software systems. 

    It provides a flexible and scalable way for applications to exchange data over the internet, 
    typically using lightweight formats like JSON. 

YAML!
    YAML ("YAML Ain't Markup Language") is a human-readable data serialization language commonly used for configuration files, 
    automation (like Ansible), and data exchange. 
    
    It uses a minimalist, whitespace-sensitive syntax to represent structured data, such as key-value pairs and lists, 
    making it easier to read than JSON or XML. 

Docker!
    Docker is an open source software platform that enables developers to package applications and their dependencies into standardized, 
    isolated units called containers. 
    This solves the common problem of "it works on my machine" by ensuring applications run consistently across different environments, 
    from a developer's laptop to testing and production servers. 

Kubernetes!
    Kubernetes (often abbreviated as K8s) is an open-source system designed to automate the deployment, scaling, 
    and management of containerized applications. Originally developed by Google, it acts as a platform for orchestration, 
    allowing developers to manage, scale, and secure containers (like Docker) across a cluster of servers. 

Web Services!
    Web services are standardized, machine-to-machine, software-driven systems that allow different applications to communicate, 
    exchange data, and share functionality over a network (like the internet). 
    They enable interoperability between disparate systems, such as Java, C++, or .NET applications, 
    by using open protocols like HTTP and XML-based messaging (SOAP or REST). 

AJAX!
    AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a web development technique that allows web pages to update data asynchronously 
    by exchanging small amounts of data with a server behind the scenes. 
    
    It enables dynamic, faster, and more responsive user experiences without requiring a full page reload. 

Visual Studio Code!
    Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a free, lightweight, and powerful open-source code editor developed by 
    Microsoft for Windows, macOS, and Linux. 
    
    It supports numerous programming languages, offering features like syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion (IntelliSense), 
    debugging, and embedded Git control. 

MS Visual Studio!
    Microsoft Visual Studio is a powerful, feature-rich Integrated Development Environment (IDE) from Microsoft used to code, debug, test, 
    and deploy applications across Windows, Android, iOS, and the web. 
    
    It supports multiple languages (C#, C++, .NET, Python) and provides tools like IntelliSense code completion, Git integration, 
    and cloud support via Azure.   

HTML!
    HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the World Wide Web. 
    It functions as the foundational "skeleton" of a webpage, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links, 
    which web browsers then interpret and display as a visible page. 

IIS!
    Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) is a flexible, secure, and manageable web server software developed by 
    Microsoft for hosting websites, services, and web applications on the Windows operating system. 

    It supports HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and other protocols to serve static or dynamic content, particularly for ASP.NET applications. 

CSS!
    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation and visual styling of a document written 
    in a markup language like HTML. It is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. 

XML!
    Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language and file format used for storing, transporting, 
    and reconstructing data in a format that is readable by both humans and machines. 
    
    Unlike HTML, which has predefined tags and is designed to display data, XML allows users to define their 
    own custom tags to describe the data's structure and meaning. 

XSLT!
    XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) is an XML-based language used to transform, restructure, 
    and convert XML documents into other formats like HTML, PDF, plain text, or different XML structures. 
    
    It acts as a processor that uses XPath to navigate data and applies rules to create new, formatted output files 
    without changing the original source. 

VBA!
    VBA stands for Visual Basic for Applications, a programming language from Microsoft that is built into most of the 
    Microsoft Office suite of applications, including Excel, Word, Access, and PowerPoint. 
    
    It is primarily used to automate repetitive tasks, create custom functions, and extend the functionality of these applications. 

GIT!
    Git is a free, open-source distributed version control system (DVCS) designed to track changes in files and 
    source code during software development. 
    
    It allows individuals and teams to work on projects simultaneously without overwriting each other's work by maintaining 
    a complete history of all modifications. 

Github!
    GitHub is a cloud-based platform that acts as a hosting service for Git repositories, enabling developers to store, manage, 
    and collaborate on code. 
    
    It uses Git for version control to track changes, allowing multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously, 
    track revisions, and merge code from different contributors. 

Citrix!
    Citrix is a software company (now part of Cloud Software Group) specializing in virtualization, networking, 
    and cloud computing technologies that enable secure remote access to applications and desktops.
