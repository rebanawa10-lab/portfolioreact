Batch file!
    A batch file is a script file that stores commands to be executed in a serial order. 
    It helps automate routine tasks without requiring user input or intervention. 
    Some common applications of batch files include loading programs, 
    running multiple processes or performing repetitive actions in a sequence in the system.

    Batch files usually have the .bat extension.

Powershell!
    PowerShell is a cross-platform task automation solution made up of a command-line shell, 
    a scripting language, and a configuration management framework. 
    PowerShell runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

    The extensible nature of PowerShell provides an ecosystem of PowerShell modules to deploy and manage almost any technology you work with. 
    For example:

    Microsoft modules
    * Azure
    * Windows
    * Exchange
    * SQL

    Third-party modules
    * AWS
    * VMware
    * Google Cloud

UiPath!
    UiPath is a global software company that provides a leading Robotic Process Automation (RPA) platform. 
    This technology enables organizations to configure computer software or a “robot” to emulate and integrate 
    the actions of a human interacting within digital systems to further execute tasks within a business process.

    RPA robots utilize the user interface to capture data and manipulate applications just like humans do. 
    They interpret, trigger responses, and communicate with other systems to perform a vast variety of repetitive tasks. 
    By doing so, UiPath helps to reduce the burden of monotonous work on employees, 
    allowing them to focus on more strategic tasks.
